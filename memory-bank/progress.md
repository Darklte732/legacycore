# Progress

## Current Status
The project appears to be an established application with multiple features and user roles. Based on the directory structure:

- Authentication system is implemented with multiple options (login, signup, magic link, password reset)
- Role-based interfaces (admin, agent, manager) are established
- Core features like applications, carriers, and settings are implemented
- AI-powered features (chat, script assistant) are present
- API endpoints for various operations are defined

Without more detailed information, it's difficult to determine exact completion status.

## What Works
Based solely on the directory structure, the following components appear to be implemented:
- Authentication flows
- Role-based routing
- Core application features for different user roles
- Supabase integration for database and authentication
- API endpoints for various operations

## What's Left to Build
Without more detailed information, we can only make general observations:
- There may be ongoing feature development
- Refinements to existing features
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes
- Additional integrations

## Known Issues
No specific issues can be identified from the directory structure alone. Further information is needed to populate this section.

## Testing Status
Information about test coverage and testing strategy is not available from the directory structure.

## Recent Milestones
No milestone information is available from the directory structure alone.

## Next Targets
Without additional context, we cannot determine specific upcoming targets for the project.

## Notes
This progress document is an initial assessment based solely on the project directory structure. It should be updated with more specific information as it becomes available.
